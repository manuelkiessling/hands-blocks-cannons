# Game Room Dimensions & Positioning

## Room Coordinate System

The game uses a right-handed coordinate system:
- **X axis**: Left (-) to Right (+)
- **Y axis**: Down (-) to Up (+)
- **Z axis**: The axis along which players face each other

## Default Room Bounds

```
Room: 14 × 10 × 16 units
  X: -7 to +7 (width: 14)
  Y: -5 to +5 (height: 10)  
  Z: -8 to +8 (depth: 16)
```

## Player Positioning

Players are positioned on **opposite ends of the Z axis**, with blocks at the very edge:

### Player 1
- **Camera**: Outside room at `z = maxZ + 8` (positive Z, looking toward negative Z)
- **Hand & Blocks**: At room edge `z = maxZ - 0.5` (accounting for block half-size)
- **X-axis mirroring**: YES - left hand movement = left on screen

### Player 2
- **Camera**: Outside room at `z = minZ - 8` (negative Z, looking toward positive Z)
- **Hand & Blocks**: At room edge `z = minZ + 0.5` (accounting for block half-size)
- **X-axis mirroring**: NO - view is already flipped from opposite perspective

## Visual Representation

## Key Rules

1. **Blocks spawn at the room edge on the player's side**
   - "My" blocks are right in front of me (no Z distance from screen)
   - "Opponent's" blocks are at the far end of the room

2. **Hand position matches block Z position**
   - Hand and blocks are at the same Z depth
   - Spread across X/Y only, fixed Z at room edge

3. **X-axis mapping depends on viewing direction**
   - Player looking from +Z: mirror X (webcam is mirrored, so un-mirror for natural feel)
   - Player looking from -Z: don't mirror (opposite view already flips X)

4. **Block positions are clamped to room bounds**
   - Account for block half-size (0.5 units) to prevent blocks from clipping through walls
   - Clamped position: `min + 0.5` to `max - 0.5` for each axis

5. **Blocks do not rotate**
   - Only gentle floating animation on Y axis
   - No rotation animation for cleaner visuals
